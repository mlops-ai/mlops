There is simple example of ML code to predict the price of a house based on its size.
The code is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn library. There is code:
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Training data
# Format: [size of house in square feet, price of house]
train_data = np.array([[2104, 400],
                       [1600, 330],
                       [2400, 369],
                       [1416, 232],
                       [3000, 540]])

# Create linear regression object
regr = LinearRegression()

# Train the model using the training sets
regr.fit(train_data[:,0].reshape(-1, 1), train_data[:,1].reshape(-1, 1))

# Test data
test_data = np.array([[1000, 200],
                      [1500, 300],
                      [2000, 400]])

# Make predictions using the testing set
predictions = regr.predict(test_data[:,0].reshape(-1, 1))

# Print predictions
print(predictions)
```
